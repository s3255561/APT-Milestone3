This test validates tile placement in lines of existing tiles;
- a tile should match a neighboring tile by EITHER colour or shape but not both as this would be the same tile.
- all tiles in a line should match by either colour or shape but no combination of both.
- validation should check that correct matching of lines is considered in both X and Y directions where a tile intersects lines.

The input sequence will attempt to place an invalid tile againt another tile (B2 and P1).
Then it will try to place an invalid tile at an intersection for two lines (P2 at D2) and expect invalid input response.
It will then try to incorrectly place a duplicate tile in one of the rows (P1 at C4).
It then tries to incorrectly match B2 with B1 where this would normally work if B1 wasn't already in a match sequence with P1.
